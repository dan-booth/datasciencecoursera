## Repository content description
You will see the following files contained in this repository:

* _run_analysis.R_; and
* _CodeBook.md_.

Please find the explanations of these files below.

### run_analysis.R
This R script performs the following tidying procedure:

1. Download a raw UCI machine learning repository dataset measuring Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer data
2. Merge the training and test data sets to create one data set
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6. From the data set in step 5, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

### CodeBook.md
This code book document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
