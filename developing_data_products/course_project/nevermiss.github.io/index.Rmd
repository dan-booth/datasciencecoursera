### Upper case conversion
* **Convert this**:
```
"I really wish I could make this text all UPPER case."
```
* **to this**:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
stringr::str_to_upper("I really wish I could make this text all UPPER case.")
```

### Lower case conversion
* **Convert this**:
```
"MAKE ME lower CASE please."
```
* **to this**:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
stringr::str_to_lower("MAKE ME lower CASE please.")
```

### Title case conversion
* **Convert this**:
```
"THERE ARE TOO MANY CAPS IN THIS."
```
* **to this**:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
